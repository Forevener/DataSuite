<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Data upload and filter page</strong></p>
<br>
<p>This page allows you to upload files of the following formats to the application:</p>
<ul>
    <li>*.csv</li>
    <li>*.dta</li>
    <li>*.ods</li>
    <li>*.por</li>
    <li>*.sas</li>
    <li>*.sav</li>
    <li>*.tsv</li>
    <li>*.xls</li>
    <li>*.xlsx</li>
    <li>*.xpt</li>
    <li>*.zsav</li>
</ul>
<p>The data file must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Table rows represent cases / subjects</li>
    <li>Table columns represent variables</li>
    <li>The first row (and only it) should contain the names of variables</li>
</ul>
<p>Empty columns and empty rows will be removed from the table automatically.</p>
<br>
<p>Using the search or filtering tools in the table, you can select cases (subjects) for processing in all further analyzes.</p>
<p>Some variables can be excluded from the analysis if they are obviously redundant, or they allow you to select cases / subjects, but should not be involved in the analysis themselves. This may be required when comparing grouped dependent samples.</p>
<p>Until the file is uploaded, analyzes on other pages will not be available.</p>
<p>When you go from this page, the application interface is re-filled each time, and the results of previous analyzes will be deleted.</p>
