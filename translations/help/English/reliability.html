<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Reliability analysis</strong></p>
<p>When you run analysis on this page, any non-numeric variables and numerical variables with zero variance ​​are automatically removed from the data table.</p>
<p>Reliability analysis allows you to determine the consistency of items - for example, questions of one scale in a psychological questionnaire. For this analysis, the <code>psych</code> package is used.</p>
<p>For the analysis, you need to select the variables (questionnaire items or scales), the consistency of which must be determined, and additionally specify the inverse variables.</p>
<p>The first main table allows you to find the following coefficients:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cronbach's Alpha</li>
  <li>Guttman's Lambda-6 </li>
  <li>MacDonald's Omega </li>
  <li>Composite Reliability Index</li>
</ul>
<p>The second main table (drop table) demonstrates how the Alpha and Lambda-6 indicators will change if the corresponding variables are excluded.</p>
<p>The first additional table (extended drop table) shows the changes in other characteristics of the questionnaire when variables are excluded. Totals are indicated in the first line, then all variables are listed.</p>
<p>The second additional table (item statistics) shows the number of items, various correlation indicators of each element with the total result, as well as correlation changes when a variable is excluded.</p>
